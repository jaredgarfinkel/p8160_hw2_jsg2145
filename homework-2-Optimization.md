# Problem 1

Design an optmization algorithm to find the minimum of the continuously
differentiable function \(f(x) =-e^{-1}\sin(x)\) on the closed interval
\([0,1.5]\). Write out your algorithm and implement it into .

# Problem 2

The Poisson distribution is often used to model \`\`count’’ data — e.g.,
the number of events in a given time period.  
The Poisson regression model states that
\[Y_i \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i),\] where
\[\log \lambda_i = \alpha + \beta x_i \] for some explanatory variable
\(x_i\). The question is how to estimate \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) given
a set of independent data
\((x_1, Y_1), (x_2, Y_2), \ldots, (x_n, Y_n)\).

The Poisson distribution is given by
\[P(Y=y) = \frac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}\] for \(\lambda > 0\).

Consider the ABO blood type data, where you have
\(N_{\mbox{obs}} = (N_A,N_B,N_O,N_{AB}) = ( 26, 27, 42, 7)\).
